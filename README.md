# Orrery Web App - NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024

## Project Description

This Orrery web app is designed to display Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) in a visually interactive format. The goal of the project is to provide users with real-time data on NEOs, enabling them to explore the paths, sizes, and trajectories of these objects relative to Earth.

This project was developed as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024, specifically addressing the "Create an Orrery Web App That Displays Near-Earth Objects" challenge. The app provides a graphical representation of the orbits of NEOs, utilizing data from NASA’s Near-Earth Object Program.

## Features

- **Visual Representation of NEOs**: A dynamic, graphical interface displaying the orbits of Near-Earth Objects.
- **Real-time Data**: Integration with NASA's data feeds to show real-time information about NEOs.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Users can click on individual objects to learn more about them (e.g., size, speed, distance from Earth).

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: This file contains the structure and layout of the webpage. It includes the elements that display the Orrery and information about NEOs.
- `scrpt.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for the functionality of the web app. This script retrieves data from the NASA API and renders it into the Orrery simulation.
- `style.css`: Defines the styling of the webpage, making it visually appealing and responsive.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser to run the application.
3. Ensure you have an active internet connection for retrieving live NEO data from NASA’s API.

## Dependencies

- **NASA API**: The web app utilizes NASA’s Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) to fetch real-time data about NEOs.
- **JavaScript**: The interactive features and data fetching are implemented using JavaScript.

## Future Enhancements

- **3D Visualization**: Expand the current 2D orrery into a 3D model for better visualization of NEOs in space.
- **Detailed Analytics**: Include more detailed information such as the probability of impact and potential damage in case of collision.
- **User Settings**: Allow users to customize their view, such as showing only objects of a certain size or trajectory.
